## Hello there...

I am a C# software developer, having written a few libraries/snaps/applications from the projects I'm experimenting on.  

My name is Ruhan, curious on how things work (software wise) and a person with deep knowledge on   
industrial control protocols, embedded computer hardware and a insiatable itch for diagnosing and fixing problems.

Currently residing in Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa  
Have a congenital hearing impairment and wear hearing aids  
Electronics tinkerer  
Leveraging my experience in Linux systems and hardware–software integration, frequently consulted with to advise on custom hardware design and Linux support considerations.  
Highly practical with a strong inclination for DIY problem-solving.


🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - CirclePiDeskClock -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/CirclePiDeskclock
  - Porting Ubuntu-Rockchip for Radxa CM3 -> Links to be added soon

🌱 I’m currently learning:  
  - C/C++
  - C# and interfacing between Linux and .NET (Marshaling, P/Invoke)
  - Some HTML and JS for basic front-end development
  - Bash scripting
  - Learning how to use and build custom Linux OS images from kernel sources and using Buildroot or a rootfs, and using RAUC for immutable, recoverable OS updates.

  - Ubuntu RootFS bootstrapper for arm64 using chroot -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/ubuntu-rootfs-builder
  - Custom RTC tool using raw i2c transactions to interact with RTC's -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/RTCSyncTool
  - Customised flashing OS image tool/script (flashOS) -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/buildroot-fOS
  - RAUC Update bundler script (internal development) -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/RAUC-Bundler-Script
  - Embstar MP05 router module infodump for new OpenWRT builds -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/embstar_infodump
  - Custom support for Fortinet FAP321C Access point -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/openwrt-ruhan/tree/ath79-fp321c (Pull request pending, must revisit)
  - Arduino code for WS2812 LED bow-tie code on ATTiny85  -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/StarTie
  - Ubuntu Core kernel patch-sets for mainlined 5.10.y and 5.15.y kernels
    - 5.10.y -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/UbuntuCore-5.10-kernelpatch
    - 5.15.y -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/UbuntuCore-5.15.y-kernelpatch
  - Various Canonical Snap packages
    - minicom snap -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/minicom-snap
    - pci-utils and usb-utils snap -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/pciutils-snap

    - Old, deprecated raspi-gpio snap (Used for internal testing) -> https://github.com/RuhanSA079/raspi-gpio-snap

✨ What I wish to achieve:
 - Contribute more to open-source projects and support the communities with knowledge I have gained from the years,
   from doing all sorts of work-related projects and personal projects.
